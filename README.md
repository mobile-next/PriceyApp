**Pricey** is a macOS status bar app that tracks your Claude Code AI usage costs in real-time and compares them to human developer costs. See exactly how your AI expenses stack up against traditional development - because spending $5 on AI that saves 2 hours of developer time is a bargain! ü§ñüí∞

## Features

- üí∞ **Real-time cost tracking** - See your Claude costs live in your menu bar
- üìä **Code statistics** - Track lines of code added and removed by Claude Code
- üíº **Salary calculator** - Calculate how much developer time you're saving
- üéØ **Model-specific pricing** - Accurate costs for different Claude models
- üîÑ **Auto-refresh** - Automatically updates on code changes
- ‚ö° **Lightweight** - Minimal resource usage, lives quietly in your menu bar

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- macOS 14.0 or later
- Claude Code app installed

### Installation

1. **Download the latest release** from the [releases page](https://github.com/mobile-next/pricey/releases)
2. **Move to Applications** - Drag `Pricey.app` to your Applications folder
3. **Launch** - Open Pricey from your Applications folder
4. **Grant permissions** - Allow file access when prompted

The app will automatically start tracking your Claude usage and display costs in your menu bar.

## How It Works

Pricey reads your Claude project files from `~/.claude/projects` and calculates costs based on:

- **Input tokens** - Text you send to Claude
- **Output tokens** - Claude's responses
- **Cache creation** - When Claude creates prompt cache
- **Cache reads** - When Claude uses cached prompts

Different Claude models have different pricing, and Pricey automatically detects which model was used for each conversation.

## Usage

### Menu Bar Display

The menu bar shows your current session costs (e.g., `$4.123`). Click the dollar sign icon to see:

- **Code statistics** - Lines added/removed
- **Salary savings** - Estimated developer time saved
- **Reset** - Clear current session costs
- **Settings** - Configure the app

### Settings

Configure Pricey to match your workflow:

- **Launch at startup** - Start Pricey automatically
- **Lines per day** - Your coding productivity (for salary calculation)
- **Yearly salary** - Your annual income (for savings calculation)

## FAQ

### Why is the app not showing costs?

Make sure:
- Claude Code is installed and you've used it
- You've granted file access permissions
- Project files exist in `~/.claude/projects`

### Can I track costs for other AI services?

Currently, Pricey only supports Claude. We'd love to add support for other services if there's interest!

### Is my data secure?

Yes! Pricey only reads local files and never sends data anywhere. All processing happens locally on your Mac.

### Why does the app need file access?

Pricey reads Claude's local project files to calculate token usage and costs. This is read-only access to your `~/.claude/projects` directory.
